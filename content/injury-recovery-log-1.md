**Injury:** right knee fat pad

**Daily Treatment:**

- McConnell fat pad taping (V)
- Icing
- NSAIDs every other day once
- KOT Zero Formula program

**Thoughts**:

It's been approximately 52 days since I injured my knee. That puts me nearly at 8 weeks since injury. As of this moment in the day, I feel ambivalent towards my recovery process. Some sources on the internet have said that recovery for this takes 8-12 weeks, so I'm hopeful that once we enter into the seemingly arbitrary recovery time zone, I will start to show more improvement.

The taping today seems to help stabilize the knee and reduce pain. No icing as of yet, but that is sure to come at some point today a few times. Soon I'm headed off to the gym to continue my KOT Zero program.

I do worry that I'm overdoing the rehab and that I have not identified the biomechanical problem -- if there is one -- causing my knee issue, however, it's not productive to dwell on these passing thoughts. 

To end on a positive, I have noticed a lot less severe popping in my knee over the last few days. I take this as a sign of the inflammation settling.
