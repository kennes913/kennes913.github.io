**Injury:** right knee fat pad

**Daily Treatment:**

- Icing
- Taping
- KOT

**Thoughts**:

The last few days have been tough mentally. I've been testing not taping the knee for a few hours per day. This usually results in a dull ache when standing and moving around, which has been quite discouraging towards the perception of progress. I've gone back to my knee being taped for most if not the whole day. Whether the science backs this or not, I definitely feel better throughout the day with my knee taped. The general idea behind taping is that it tilts the patella and reduces the pressure on the impingement.

In general, I've decided to regress various exercises in my rehab routine to try to reduce subsequent inflammation. My goal is to be able to build strength in the surrounding muscles without irritating the fat pad too much. I've also decided to try a local specialized physiotherapy practice called runlabs. I've heard good things about them and I imagine they have seen many cases of fat pad irritation. I'm hoping that they can address some underlying biomechanical issues with my running so that I don't run into this issue again.
