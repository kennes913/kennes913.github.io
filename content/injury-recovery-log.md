I am highly active and have had a hard time being injured. The psychological part of the whole process has been the most challenging. The idea of forced rest is absolutely dreadful.

And for me, I believe that the psychological challenge is rooted in a few things:
- cognitive dissonance from loss of control
- reduced sense of well-being 
- increased anxiety and less focus 

I've been thinking about creating an "Injury Recovery Journal". This journal will simply be whatever I want to say on the subject of my injury on any day that I feel like writing about it. I think the entries will tend to skew analytical but it's okay if they don't. My expectations for this are to have something to look back on and remembe and or something to help others who're dealing with the same injury, who knows?
