**Injury:** right knee fat pad

**Daily Treatment:**

- Taping
- KOT

**Thoughts**:

The last few days have been a mix of good and bad days. I would say overall the knee-not-feeling-normal symptoms are lessening one atomically small increment at a time. The tiny signal for improvement that I notice is the short periods during the day where my brain is not thinking about the knee and I begin to freely move as if I wasn't injured. On the other hand, the biggest aggravating factor seems to be standing for long periods of time which is counterintuitive because standing applies less force on the knees than walking or running.

I have now gone to two sessions at RunLab -- runner specific physiotherapy. The gait analysis they provided has been useful in that it has highlighted some biomechanical issues that are putting more stress on the knee than necessary:
- heel strikes; landing your heel first with the leg at an extended position
- hip drop; your hips dropping unevenly relative to 1 another
- foot crossover; crossing your feet over the middle of your body as you run

I've begun to modify my running gait to overcome these issues. From a two 3-mile run sample, I noticed a few things. My calves are much more sore because they take the force of the impact from mid foot strikes. Second, the knee has no pain at all during the run because the knee is in flexion when you land on the mid foot which lets the quad absorb some of the shock in addition to the calf. Lastly, modifying the crossover is quite difficult to do because it just feels unnatural to my body at the moment.

My plan over the next few weeks is to continue the KOT program while slowly building mileage up. I'm optimistic that I will be running a lot more in a month or so.
