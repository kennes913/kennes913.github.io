**Injury:** right knee fat pad

**Daily Treatment:**

- NSAIDs
- Icing

**Thoughts**:

I'm now at exactly at 8 weeks since injury. I spent the day at my father's property in the hill country. It was hard to force myself to get out there considering the wind and cold temperatures, but it was nice because I was able to stop thinking about my knee for a few hours. 

As far as treatment went, I McConnell-taped my knee. The added pressure to the knee seems to eliminate most of the ache and pain when I walk around. 

I found a good YouTube series from someone who went through the same issue as I did. He's also doing the exact same rehab program. It took him roughly a full year of to recover from PFS/Hoffa's Syndrome. I am relieved to hear he has recovered, but a 1 year timeline is a lot more time than I expected. This will certainly impact my running goals this year.
